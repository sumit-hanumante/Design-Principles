                            Factory Pattern

    This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern
    provides one of the best ways to create an object.


Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and
based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class.
This pattern take out the responsibility of instantiation of a class from client program
to the factory class.


Factory pattern provides abstraction between implementation and client classes through inheritance.
